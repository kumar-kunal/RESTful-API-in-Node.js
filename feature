API has to be written for the following functionalities:


done 1. Uploading a CSV (having field names as username (unique key), password, place, latitude and longitude in the system
done 2. The system needs to support multiple uploads. 
done 3. The subsequent uploads needs to insert and also update the documents in the case of a recurring username. 
done 4. Login and registration setup for users to access the other apis
done 5. Listing out nearby users in the user list
done 6. Ability to search users based on geo coordinates.


In brief:
We have to create a application or system. where we can upload a CSV file (one or multiple) containing user information. Now, we can give access to user to see who is nearby and who is at specific co-ordinate.
Now, to use above two feature, user must have to login. So, we also need to control token. otherwise anyone can call api directly to use that feature.

Okay,,,
So basically... It's Funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.............
